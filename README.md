# Greek Scrabble Dictionary

This repository contains all the words from the 2023 edition of the book [*«Οι λέξεις 2-8 γραμμάτων»*](https://scrabblegreek28.blogspot.com/2023/01/pdf-httpswww.html). It contains 161.134 out of 161.137 in the book. I don't know where these 3 words got lost in the parsing.

Some interesting (?) info:

The 10 most valuable words are:
1. ΞΕΦΡΑΧΘΩ, 43
2. ΞΕΣΦΙΧΘΩ, 42
3. ΕΜΨΥΧΩΘΩ, 40
4. ΞΕΒΓΑΛΘΩ, 40
5. ΞΕΒΙΔΩΘΩ, 40
6. ΞΕΡΙΖΩΘΩ, 40
7. ΔΙΑΨΥΧΘΩ, 39
8. ΕΞΥΨΩΘΩ, 39
9. ΖΥΘΟΖΥΜΗ, 39
10. ΞΕΖΑΛΙΖΩ, 39

Just two letters can get you more than 10 points:
1. ΖΩ, 13
2. ΞΩ, 13
3. ΞΥ, 12
4. ΕΞ, 11
5. ΖΑ, 11
6. ΖΗ, 11

15. ΩΦ, 11
16. ΩΧ, 11
 
I don't know why I made this, I don't even play scrabble all that often. Hope it's useful to someone.
